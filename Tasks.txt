"v2" from ChatGPT:
- .folderstamp: tell when it was recursive or not
- if .folderstamp is found, rename it to ".folderstamp1" and the next will be ".folderstamp2" (use the untitled library) (mirror this feature, in verifact-hash)
- support a simple .ls (.ls1, .ls2 - use the untitled library)
- in the recursive mode, also stamp the folder (but without hash) as non-recursive do
- .folderstampignore file (pig nore? or .folderstamp-ignore file but it won't follow git's naming convention)
- hardcoded exception items, such as the very .folderstamp file and .git folder
- after "This folder: /", add the storage device manufacturer/capacity/details and add the current git branch if .git present
- IPFS CID option through the --hash flag

- at the end of .folderstamp file, tell the date it was done. option to add Ethereum's current latest block no.

--help flag

- .folderstamp.listed file; can be used to avoid listing files that were already snapshot previously

----

.file-timestamps files will be symlinks to a git folder with sharedbytes!
