"v2"(r5+) from ChatGPT:
- after "This folder: " line, add the storage device manufacturer/capacity/details (find some Linux programs that can do that)
- when stamping on Desktop: tell the current background location, items' positions and items' icons! gsettings get org.cinnamon.desktop.background picture-uri | tr -d "'" (have to detect DE, and fallback is not using this)
- in the recursive mode, also stamp the folder (but without hash) as non-recursive do
- IPFS CID option through the --hash flag
- if .folderstamp is found, rename it to ".folderstamp1" and the next will be ".folderstamp2" (use the untitled library) (mirror this feature, in verifact-hash)
- support a simple .ls (.ls1, .ls2 - use the untitled library)
- option to choose a custom number for .folderstamp (except if already existing)
- hardcoded exception items, such as the very .folderstamp file and .git folder
- .folderstampignore file (pig nore? or .folderstamp-ignore file but it won't follow git's naming convention)

- at the end of .folderstamp file, tell the date it was done. option to add Ethereum's current latest block no.

v3:
- when stamping on Desktop: beyond telling the current background: tell items' positions and items' icons!

----

.file-timestamps files will be symlinks to a git folder with sharedbytes!
- .folderstamp.listed file; can be used to avoid listing files that were already snapshot previously
