--help flag

- if .folderstamp is found, rename it to ".folderstamp1" and the next will be ".folderstamp2" (use the untitled library) (mirror this feature, in verifact-hash)
- support a simple .ls (.ls1, .ls2 - use the untitled library)
- exception items, such as the very .folderstamp file and .git folder
- .folderstamp.listed file; can be used to avoid listing files that were already snapshot previously
- .folderstampignore file (pig nore? or .folderstamp-ignore file but it won't follow git's naming convention)
- after "This folder: /", add the storage device manufacturer/capacity/details

- IPFS CID option through the --hash flag

----

.file-timestamps files will be symlinks to a git folder with sharedbytes!
