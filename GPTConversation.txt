tell on .folderstamp if mode used is recursive or non-recursive (add the "Method: " bellow "This folder: " line)








To indicate if the mode used is recursive or non-recursive in the `.folderstamp` file, you can add a line below "This folder:" with the method used. You can achieve this by modifying the [display](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/FilePeace/folderstamp/folderstamp#61%2C4-61%2C4) function in the script as follows:

```shell
7|echo "This folder: $rocketlaunch_dir"
8|echo "Method: $2"  # Add this line to show the method used
```









Wrong. It will tell "-r" or empty, instead of "Recursive" or "Non-recursive"; so, please, detect if "-r" or empty to tell what in a human-friendly way for reading.




To display "Recursive" or "Non-recursive" instead of "-r" or empty in the `.folderstamp` file, modify the [display](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/FilePeace/folderstamp/folderstamp#3%2C10-3%2C10) function as follows:

```shell
10|if [[ "$2" == "--recursive" ]] || [[ "$2" == "-r" ]]; then
11|   method="Recursive"
12|else
13|   method="Non-recursive"
14|fi
15|echo "Method: $method"  # Add this line to show the method used in a human-friendly way
```
