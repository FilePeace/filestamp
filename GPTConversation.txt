It seems like the issue is related to invalid format characters in the printf statements. To fix this, you need to escape the percentage signs in the printf statements by doubling them up. Update the lines in the [folderstamp](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/FilePeace/folderstamp/Tasks.txt#3%2C4-3%2C4) script where printf is used to replace `%` with `%%`. Here is the updated code snippet:

```folderstamp
40|    printf "$all" | sed 's/%/%%/g'
```
